Q1. Whatâ€™s const-correctness and why is it important?
A1. Const-correctness refers to the practice of using the const keyword properly in C++ to indicate which parts of a program should not modify data.
By marking a variable, parameter, or function as const, you prevent accidental modification of data, this makes your code safer.

Q2. Is your class const-correct? How do you know?
A2. Yes.
