Marriage Pact

Q1. It is your choice to use either an ordered or unordered set. In a few sentences, what are some of the tradeoffs between the two? Additionally, please give an example (that has not been shown in lecture) of a valid hash function that could be used to hash student names for an unordered set.
A1. I chose unordered_set because I don't care whether the names are sorted, and the sequential traversal of unordered_set is faster than that of set.

Q2. Note that we are saving pointers to names in the queue, not names themselves. Why might this be desired in this problem? What happens if the original set where the names are stored goes out of scope and the pointers are referenced?
A2. Since I only need to access the strings and do not need to modify them, storing string pointers can save memory and avoid unnecessary string copies. 
If the original set where the names are stored goes out of scope and the pointers are referenced, undefined behavior will occur, as the pointers will be dangling.
