 * If you're reading this welcome to CS106L! For this assignment you don't 
 * actually need to write any C++ code. Instead, you'll be setting up your
 * environment and getting familiar with the tools we'll be using in the course.
 * The code in this file will verify that your installation is correct and that 
 * the autograder is working properly.
